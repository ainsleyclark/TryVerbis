interface.\n//\n//   map:: (pos: number, assoc: ?number) → number\n//   Map a position through this object. When given, `assoc` (should\n//   be -1 or 1, defaults to 1) determines with which side the\n//   position is associated, which determines in which direction to\n//   move when a chunk of content is inserted at the mapped position.\n//\n//   mapResult:: (pos: number, assoc: ?number) → MapResult\n//   Map a position, and return an object containing additional\n//   information about the mapping.

The view will then take\n// care to call `preventDefault` on the event, except with\n// `handleDOMEvents`, where the handler itself is responsible for that.\n//\n// How a prop is resolved depends on the prop. Handler functions are\n// called one at a time, starting with the base props and then\n// searching through the plugins (in order of appearance) until one of\n// them returns true. For some props, the first plugin that yields a\n// value gets precedence.\n//\n//   handleDOMEvents:: ?Object<(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event) → bool>\n//   Can be an object mapping DOM event type names to functions that\n//   handle them. Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied. If it returns `true`, the default\n//   behavior of actually inserting the text is suppressed.\n//\n//   handleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a click, from the inside out. The\n//   `direct` flag will be true for the inner node.\n//\n//   handleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is clicked, after `handleClickOn` handlers\n//   have been called.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a double click.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is double-clicked, after `handleDoubleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handleTripleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a triple click.\n//\n//   handleTripleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is triple-clicked, after `handleTripleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handlePaste:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.ClipboardEvent, slice: Slice) → bool\n//   Can be used to override the behavior of pasting. `slice` is the\n//   pasted content parsed by the editor, but you can directly access\n//   the event to get at the raw content.\n//\n//   handleDrop:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event, slice: Slice, moved: bool) → bool\n//   Called when something is dropped on the editor. `moved` will be\n//   true if this drop moves from the current selection (which should\n//   thus be deleted).\n//\n//   handleScrollToSelection:: ?(view: EditorView) → bool\n//   Called when the view, after updating its state, tries to scroll\n//   the selection into view. A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM. Defaults to calling\n//   [`DOMParser.fromSchema`](#model.DOMParser^fromSchema) on the\n//   editor's schema.\n//\n//   transformPastedHTML:: ?(html: string) → string\n//   Can be used to transform pasted HTML text, _before_ it is parsed,\n//   for example to clean it up.\n//\n//   clipboardParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading content from\n//   the clipboard. When not given, the value of the\n//   [`domParser`](#view.EditorProps.domParser) prop is used.\n//\n//   transformPastedText:: ?(text: string, plain: bool) → string\n//   Transform pasted plain text. The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice. Called after\n//   [`transformPastedText`](#view.EditorProps.transformPastedText).\n//   The default behavior is to split the text into lines, wrap them\n//   in `<p>` tags, and call\n//   [`clipboardParser`](#view.EditorProps.clipboardParser) on it.\n//   The `plain` flag will be true when the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   transformPasted:: ?(Slice) → Slice\n//   Can be used to transform pasted content before it is applied to\n//   the document.\n//\n//   nodeViews:: ?Object<(node: Node, view: EditorView, getPos: () → number, decorations: [Decoration]) → NodeView>\n//   Allows you to pass custom rendering and behavior logic for nodes\n//   and marks. Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSet\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view. Defaults to 5.\n\n// DirectEditorProps:: interface extends EditorProps\n//\n// The props object given directly to the editor view supports two\n// fields that can't be used in plugins:\n//\n//   state:: EditorState\n//   The current state of the editor.\n//\n//   dispatchTransaction:: ?(tr: Transaction)\n//   The callback over which to send transactions (state updates)\n//   produced by the view. If you specify this, you probably want to\n//   make sure this ends up calling the view's\n//   [`updateState`](#view.EditorView.updateState) method with a new\n//   state that has the transaction\n//   [applied](#state.EditorState.apply). The callback will be bound to have\n//   the view instance as its `this` binding.\n\nexport { Decoration, DecorationSet, EditorView, endComposition as __endComposition, parseFromClipboard as __parseFromClipboard, serializeForClipboard as __serializeForClipboard };\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.es.js.map\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-3!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FlexibleContent.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=e5092642&scoped=true&lang=scss&\";

A definite end match, but when `doEndMatch` tries to \"reapply\"\n      the end rule and fails to match, we wind up here, and just silently ignore the end.\n\n      This causes no real harm other than stopping a few times too many.\n      */\n\n      mode_buffer += lexeme;\n      return lexeme.length;\n    }\n\n    var language = getLanguage(languageName);\n    if (!language) {\n      console.error(LANGUAGE_NOT_FOUND.replace(\"{}\", languageName));\n      throw new Error('Unknown language: \"' + languageName + '\"');\n    }\n\n    var md = compileLanguage(language);\n    var result = '';\n    /** @type {CompiledMode} */\n    var top = continuation || md;\n    /** @type Record<string,Mode> */\n    var continuations = {}; // keep continuations for sub-languages\n    var emitter = new options.__emitter(options);\n    processContinuations();\n    var mode_buffer = '';\n    var relevance = 0;\n    var index = 0;\n    var iterations = 0;\n    var resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n\n    try {\n      top.matcher.considerAll();\n\n      for (;;) {\n        iterations++;\n        if (resumeScanAtSamePosition) {\n          // only regexes not matched previously will now be\n          // considered for a potential match\n          resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n        } else {\n          top.matcher.lastIndex = index;\n          top.matcher.considerAll();\n        }\n\n        const match = top.matcher.exec(codeToHighlight);\n        // console.log(\"match\", match[0], match.rule && match.rule.begin)\n\n        // if our failure to match was the result of a \"resumed scan\" then we\n        // need to advance one position and revert to full scanning before we\n        // decide there are truly no more matches at all to be had\n        if (!match && top.matcher.resumingScanAtSamePosition()) {\n          advanceOne();\n          continue;\n        }\n        if (!match) break;\n\n        const beforeMatch = codeToHighlight.substring(index, match.index);\n        const processedCount = processLexeme(beforeMatch, match);\n        index = match.index + processedCount;\n      }\n      processLexeme(codeToHighlight.substr(index));\n      emitter.closeAllNodes();\n      emitter.finalize();\n      result = emitter.toHTML();\n\n      return {\n        relevance: relevance,\n        value: result,\n        language: languageName,\n        illegal: false,\n        emitter: emitter,\n        top: top\n      };\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (err.message && err.message.includes('Illegal')) {\n        return {\n          illegal: true,\n          illegalBy: {\n            msg: err.message,\n            context: codeToHighlight.slice(index - 100, index + 100),\n            mode: err.mode\n          },\n          sofar: result,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter\n        };\n      } else if (SAFE_MODE) {\n        return {\n          illegal: false,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter,\n          language: languageName,\n          top: top,\n          errorRaised: err\n        };\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * returns a valid highlight result, without actually doing any actual work,\n   * auto highlight starts with this and it's possible for small snippets that\n   * auto-detection may not find a better match\n   * @param {string} code\n   * @returns {HighlightResult}\n   */\n  function justTextHighlightResult(code) {\n    const result = {\n      relevance: 0,\n      emitter: new options.__emitter(options),\n      value: escape$1(code),\n      illegal: false,\n      top: PLAINTEXT_LANGUAGE\n    };\n    result.emitter.addText(code);\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  Highlighting with language detection.
