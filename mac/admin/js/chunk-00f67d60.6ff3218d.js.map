Only one occasion now.  An end match that was\n      triggered but could not be completed.  When might this happen?  When an `endSameasBegin`\n      rule sets the end rule to a specific match.  Since the overall mode termination rule that's\n      being used to scan the text isn't recompiled that means that any match that LOOKS like\n      the end (but is not, because it is not an exact match to the beginning) will\n      end up here.  A definite end match, but when `doEndMatch` tries to \"reapply\"\n      the end rule and fails to match, we wind up here, and just silently ignore the end.\n\n      This causes no real harm other than stopping a few times too many.\n      */\n\n      mode_buffer += lexeme;\n      return lexeme.length;\n    }\n\n    var language = getLanguage(languageName);\n    if (!language) {\n      console.error(LANGUAGE_NOT_FOUND.replace(\"{}\", languageName));\n      throw new Error('Unknown language: \"' + languageName + '\"');\n    }\n\n    var md = compileLanguage(language);\n    var result = '';\n    /** @type {CompiledMode} */\n    var top = continuation || md;\n    /** @type Record<string,Mode> */\n    var continuations = {}; // keep continuations for sub-languages\n    var emitter = new options.__emitter(options);\n    processContinuations();\n    var mode_buffer = '';\n    var relevance = 0;\n    var index = 0;\n    var iterations = 0;\n    var resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n\n    try {\n      top.matcher.considerAll();\n\n      for (;;) {\n        iterations++;\n        if (resumeScanAtSamePosition) {\n          // only regexes not matched previously will now be\n          // considered for a potential match\n          resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n        } else {\n          top.matcher.lastIndex = index;\n          top.matcher.considerAll();\n        }\n\n        const match = top.matcher.exec(codeToHighlight);\n        // console.log(\"match\", match[0], match.rule && match.rule.begin)\n\n        // if our failure to match was the result of a \"resumed scan\" then we\n        // need to advance one position and revert to full scanning before we\n        // decide there are truly no more matches at all to be had\n        if (!match && top.matcher.resumingScanAtSamePosition()) {\n          advanceOne();\n          continue;\n        }\n        if (!match) break;\n\n        const beforeMatch = codeToHighlight.substring(index, match.index);\n        const processedCount = processLexeme(beforeMatch, match);\n        index = match.index + processedCount;\n      }\n      processLexeme(codeToHighlight.substr(index));\n      emitter.closeAllNodes();\n      emitter.finalize();\n      result = emitter.toHTML();\n\n      return {\n        relevance: relevance,\n        value: result,\n        language: languageName,\n        illegal: false,\n        emitter: emitter,\n        top: top\n      };\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (err.message && err.message.includes('Illegal')) {\n        return {\n          illegal: true,\n          illegalBy: {\n            msg: err.message,\n            context: codeToHighlight.slice(index - 100, index + 100),\n            mode: err.mode\n          },\n          sofar: result,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter\n        };\n      } else if (SAFE_MODE) {\n        return {\n          illegal: false,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter,\n          language: languageName,\n          top: top,\n          errorRaised: err\n        };\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * returns a valid highlight result, without actually doing any actual work,\n   * auto highlight starts with this and it's possible for small snippets that\n   * auto-detection may not find a better match\n   * @param {string} code\n   * @returns {HighlightResult}\n   */\n  function justTextHighlightResult(code) {\n    const result = {\n      relevance: 0,\n      emitter: new options.__emitter(options),\n      value: escape$1(code),\n      illegal: false,\n      top: PLAINTEXT_LANGUAGE\n    };\n    result.emitter.addText(code);\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  Highlighting with language detection.
